:obj:`SimpleTreeLearner` is an implementation of regression and classification
trees. It is faster than :obj:`TreeLearner` at the expense of flexibility.
It uses gain ratio for classification and MSE for regression.

:obj:`SimpleTreeLearner` was developed for speeding up the construction
of random forests, but can also be used as a standalone tree learner.

.. class:: SimpleTreeLearner

    .. attribute:: max_majority

        Maximal proportion of majority class. When this is exceeded,
        induction stops (only used for classification).

    .. attribute:: min_instances

        Minimal number of instances in leaves. Instance count is weighed.

    .. attribute:: max_depth

        Maximal depth of tree.

    .. attribute:: skip_prob

        At every split an attribute will be skipped with probability ``skip_prob``.
        Useful for building random forests.

    .. attribute:: random_generator
        
        Provide your own :obj:`Orange.misc.Random`.
