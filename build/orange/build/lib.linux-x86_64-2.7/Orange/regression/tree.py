Regression trees (``tree``)
***************************

Regression tree shares its implementation with Orange.classification.tree.TreeLearner,
but uses a different set of functions to evaluate node splitting and stop
criteria. Usage of regression trees is straightforward as demonstrated on the
following example (:download:`regression-tree-run.py <code/regression-tree-run.py>`):

.. literalinclude:: code/regression-tree-run.py
   :lines: 7-

.. autoclass:: TreeLearner
    :members:

.. autoclass:: TreeClassifier
    :members:

SimpleTreeLearner

A basic example of using a SimpleTreeLearner is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: code/simple_tree_regression.py
