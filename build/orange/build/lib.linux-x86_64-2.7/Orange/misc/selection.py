Selection (``selection``)

.. index:: selection
.. index::
   single: misc; selection

Many machine learning techniques generate a set of different solutions or
have to choose, as for instance in classification tree induction, between
different features. The most trivial solution is to iterate through the 
candidates, compare them and remember the optimal one. The problem occurs,
however, when there are multiple candidates that are equally good, and the
naive approaches would select the first or the last one, depending upon the
formulation of the if-statement.

:class:`Orange.misc.selection` provides a class that makes a random choice
in such cases. Each new candidate is compared with the currently optimal
one; it replaces the optimal if it is better, while if they are equal,
one is chosen by random. The number of competing optimal candidates is stored,
so in this random choice the probability to select the new candidate (over the
current one) is 1/w, where w is the current number of equal candidates,
including the present one. One can easily verify that this gives equal
chances to all candidates, independent of the order in which they are
presented.

Example
--------

The following snippet loads the data set lymphography and prints out the
feature with the highest information gain.

part of :download:`misc-selection-bestonthefly.py <code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py>`

.. literalinclude:: code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py
  :lines: 7-16

Our candidates are tuples gain ratios and features, so we set
:obj:`call_compare_on_1st` to make the compare function compare the first
element (gain ratios). We could achieve the same by initializing the object
like this:

part of :download:`misc-selection-bestonthefly.py <code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py>`

.. literalinclude:: code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py
  :lines: 18-18


The other way to do it is through indices.

:download:`misc-selection-bestonthefly.py <code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py>`

.. literalinclude:: code/misc-selection-bestonthefly.py
  :lines: 25-

Here we only give gain ratios to :obj:`BestOnTheFly`, so we don't have
to specify a special compare operator. After checking all features we
get the index of the  optimal one by calling :obj:`winner_index`.
