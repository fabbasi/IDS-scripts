<P>Signal <code>Regression Tree</code> sends data only if the learning data (signal <code>Examples</code> is present.</P>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This widget constructs a regression tree learning algorithm. As all widgets for classification and regression, this widget provides a learner and classifier/regressor on the output. Learner is a learning algorithm with settings as specified by the user. It can be fed into widgets for testing learners, for instance <code>Test Learners</code>.</p>

<P>Learner can be given a name under which it will appear in, say, <code>Test Learners</code>. The default name is "Regression Tree".</P>

<P>If <code>Binarization</code> is checked, the values of multivalued attributes are split into two groups (based on the statistics in the particular node) to yield a binary tree. Binarization gets rid of the usual measures' bias towards attributes with more values and is generally recommended.</P>

<P>The widget can be instructed to prune the tree during induction by setting <span class="option">Do not split nodes with less instances than</span>. For pruning after induction, there is pruning with m-estimate of error.</P>

<P>After changing one or more settings, you need to push <span class="option">Apply</span>, which will put the new learner on the output and, if the training examples are given, construct a new classifier and output it as well.</P>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<P>There are two typical uses of this widget. First, you may want to induce the model and check what it looks like with the schema below.

<P>The second schema checks the accuracy of the algorithm.</P>
