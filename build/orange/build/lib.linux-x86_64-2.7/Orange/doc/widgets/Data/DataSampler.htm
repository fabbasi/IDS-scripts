<h3>Outputs</h3>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Data Sampler supports provides support for several means of
sampling of the data from the input channel and outputs the sampled
data set and complementary data set (with instances from the input set
that are not included in the sampled data set). Output is set when the
input data set is set to the widget or after <span class="option">Sample Data</span> is
pressed.</p>

<p>Sampling may be stratified: if input data contains a class,
sampling will try to match its class distribution in the output data
sets.</p>

<p>Several types of sampling are supported. <span class="option">Random
sampling</span> can draw a
fixed number of instances or create a data set with a size set as
a proportion of instances from the input data set. In repeated
sampling, an data instance may be included in a sampled data several
times (like in bootstrap).</p>

<p><span class="option">Cross validation</span>,
<span class="option">Leave-one-out</span> or sampling that creates
<span class="option">Multiple subsets</span> of preset sample sizes relative to the input data set
(like random sampling) all create several data samples. Which one is
send to the output is determined by the data set index in <span class="option">Fold/Group</span>
(indices start with 1).</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Schema where we have sampled 10 data instances from Iris data set
and presented this selection in <a

below.</p>
