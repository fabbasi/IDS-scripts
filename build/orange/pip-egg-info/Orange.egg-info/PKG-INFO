Description: Orange data mining library
        ==========================
        
        Orange is a scriptable environment for fast prototyping of new
        algorithms and testing schemes. It is a collection of Python packages
        that sit over the core library and implement some functionality for
        which execution time is not crucial and which is easier done in Python
        than in C++. This includes a variety of tasks such as attribute subset,
        bagging and boosting, and alike.
        
        Orange also includes a set of graphical widgets that use methods from 
        core library and Orange modules. Through visual programming, widgets
        can be assembled together into an application by a visual programming
        tool called Orange Canvas.
