<H1>Graphing and Orange Widgets</H1>
 
<p>The most fun widgets are of course those that include graphics. For
this we either use control called canvas, which is Qt's general
control for doing any graphics of choice (widgets for tree and heat map
visualizations, for instance, use this), or use a special control for
drawing data plots as provided in Qwt library and PyQwt
interface. Here we look at the latter, and extend our learning curve
widget with a control that plots the curve.</p>

<h2>Plots</h2>

<p>Let us construct a widget with a following appearance:</p>

<img src="learningcurve-plot.png">

<p>There are two new elements from our previous incarnation of
a learning curve widget: a control with a list of classifiers, and a
graph with a plot of learning curves. From a list of classifiers we
can select those to be displayed in the plot.</p>

<p>The widget still provides learning curve table, but this is now
offered in a tabbed pane together with a graph. The code for
definition of the tabbed pane, and initialization of the graph is:</p>

<xmp class="code"># start of content (right) area
tabs = OWGUI.tabWidget(self.mainArea)

# graph widget
tab = OWGUI.createTabPage(tabs, "Graph")
self.graph = OWGraph(tab)
self.graph.setAxisAutoScale(QwtPlot.xBottom)
self.graph.setAxisAutoScale(QwtPlot.yLeft)
tab.layout().addWidget(self.graph)
self.setGraphGrid()
</xmp>

<p><code>OWGrap</code> is a convenience subclass of QwtPlot and is imported from OWGraph module. For the graph, we use <code>setAxisAutoScale</code> to
request that the axis are automatically set in regard to the data that
is plotted in the graph. We plot the graph in using the following
code:</p>

<xmp class="code">def drawLearningCurve(self, learner):
    if not self.data: return
    curve = self.graph.addCurve(learner.name, xData=self.curvePoints, yData=learner.score, autoScale=True)
    
    learner.curve = curve
    self.setGraphStyle(learner)
    self.graph.replot()
</xmp>

<p>This is simple. We store the curve returned from <code>addCurve</code> with a
learner, and use a trick allowed in Orange that we can simply store
this as a new attribute to the learning object. By default, Orange
would give a warning of the type</p>

<xmp class="code">c:\Python23\Lib\site-packages\orange\OrangeWidgets\Test\OWLearningCurveC.py:269:
 AttributeWarning: 'curve' is not a builtin attribute of 'kNNLearner'
  setattr(learner, "curve", curve)
</xmp>

<p>but we surpress such warnings with a line</p>

<xmp class="code">warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", ".*builtin attribute.*", orange.AttributeWarning)
</xmp>

<p>in the initialization part of the widget. In this way, each learner
also stores the current scores, which is a list of numbers to be
plotted in Qwt graph. The details on how the plot is set are dealt
with in <code>setGraphStyle</code> function:</code></p>

<xmp class="code">def setGraphStyle(self, learner):
    curve = learner.curve
    if self.graphDrawLines:
        curve.setStyle(QwtPlotCurve.Lines)
    else:
        curve.setStyle(QwtPlotCurve.NoCurve)
    curve.setSymbol(QwtSymbol(QwtSymbol.Ellipse, \
      QBrush(QColor(0,0,0)), QPen(QColor(0,0,0)),
      QSize(self.graphPointSize, self.graphPointSize)))
    curve.setPen(QPen(learner.color, 5))
</xmp>

<p>Notice that the color of the plot line that is specific to the
learner is stored in its attribute <code>color</code>
(<code>learner.color</code>). Who sets it and how? This we discuss in
the following subsection.</p>

<h2>Colors in Orange Widgets</h2>

<p>Uniform assignment of colors across different widget is an
important issue. When we plot the same data in different widgets, we
expect that the color we used in a consistent way; for instance data
instances of one class should be plotted in scatter plot and parallel
axis plot using the same color. Developers are thus advised to use
<code>ColorPaletteHSV</code>, which is provided as a method within
<code>OWWidget</code> class. <code>ColorPaletteHSV</code> takes an
integer as an attribute, and returns a list of corresponding number of
colors. In our learning curve widget, we use it within a function that
sets the list box with learners:</p>

<xmp class="code">def updatellb(self):
    self.blockSelectionChanges = 1
    self.llb.clear()
    colors = ColorPaletteHSV(len(self.learners))
    for (i,lt) in enumerate(self.learners):
        l = lt[1]
        item = QListWidgetItem(ColorPixmap(colors[i]), l.name)
        self.llb.addItem(item)
        item.setSelected(l.isSelected)
        l.color = colors[i]
    self.blockSelectionChanges = 0
</xmp>

<p>The code above sets the items of the list box, where each item
includes a learner and a small box in learner's color, which is in
this widget also used as a sort of a legend for the graph. This box is
returned by <code>ColorPixmap</code> function defined in
<code>OWColorPalette.py</code>. Else, the classifier's list box control is
defined in the initialization of the widget using:</p>

<xmp class="code">self.cbox = OWGUI.widgetBox(self.controlArea, "Learners")
self.llb = OWGUI.listBox(self.cbox, self, "selectedLearners", selectionMode=QListWidget.MultiSelection, callback=self.learnerSelectionChanged)

self.llb.setMinimumHeight(50)
self.blockSelectionChanges = 0
</xmp>

</p>Now, what is this <code>blockSelectionChanges</code>? Any time
user makes a selection change in list box of classifiers, we want to
invoke the procedure called
<code>learnerSelectionChanged</code>. But we want to perform
actions there when changes in the list box are invoked from clicking
by a user, and not by changing list box items from a program. This is
why, every time we want <code>learnerSelectionChanged</code> not to
perform its function, we set <code>self.blockSelectionChanges</code>
to 1.</p>

<p>In our widget, <code>learnerSelectionChanged</code> figures out
if any curve should be removed from the graph (the user has just
deselected the corresponding item in the list box) or added to the
graph (the user just selected a learner):</p>

<xmp class="code">def learnerSelectionChanged(self):
    if self.blockSelectionChanges: return
    for (i,lt) in enumerate(self.learners):
        l = lt[1]
        if l.isSelected != (i in self.selectedLearners):
            if l.isSelected: # learner was deselected
                l.curve.detach()
            else: # learner was selected
                self.drawLearningCurve(l)
            self.graph.replot()
        l.isSelected = i in self.selectedLearners
</xmp>

<p>The complete code of this widget is available <a
href="OWLearningCurveC.py">here</a>. This is almost like a typical
widget that is include in a standard Orange distribution, with a
typical size just under 300 lines. Just some final cosmetics is needed
to make this widget a standard one, including setting some graph
properties (like line and point sizes, grid line control, etc.) and
saving the graph to an output file.</p>
