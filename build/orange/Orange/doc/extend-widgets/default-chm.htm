<h1>Visual Programming &amp; Widgets</h1>

<p>Orange's graphical user interface revolves around data mining
components called widgets and visual programming as a tool to assemble
the widgets into applications and use them (in any way and combination
you require) for explorative data analysis.</p>

<p>We have spent much time writing many widgets in the past several
years. While we really like widgets, and we even like programming them
(as having a nice visual component of your own can be really
rewarding), we also got a bit lazy. Being lazy is intrinsic to any
human, so we aimed at minimizing our effort (e.g., fewest lines
possible) while maximizing the outcome (building some nice widgets
fast). To do this, we have set up the environment (base widget class)
and several libraries to please us, the developers. If you are about
to start writing your own widgets, or are just interested how we do
it, the following documentation should get you started.</p>
