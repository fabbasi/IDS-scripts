<H1>Channels and Tokens</H1>
 
<p>Our data sampler widget was, regarding the channels, rather simple
and linear: the widget was designed to receive the token from one
widget, and send an output token to another widget. Just like in an
example schema below:</p>

<p>There's quite a bit more to channels and management of tokens, and
we will overview most of the stuff you need to know to make your more
complex widgets in this section.</p>

<h2>Multi-Input Channels</h2>

<p>First, I do not like the name, but can't make up anything better. In
essence, the basic idea about "multi-input" channels is that they can
be used to connect them with several output channels. That is, if a
widget supports such a channel, several widgets can feed their input
to that widget simultaneously.</p>

<p>Say we want to build a widget that takes a data set and test
various predictive modelling techniques on it. A widget has to have an
input data channel, and this we know how to deal with from our <a
href="settings.htm">previous</a> lesson. But, somehow differently, we
want to connect any number of widgets which define learners to our
testing widget. Just like in a schema below, where three different
learners are used:</p>

<img src="learningcurve.png">

<p>We will here take a look at how we define the channels for a learning
curve widget, and how we manage its input tokens. But before we do it,
just in brief: learning curve is something that you can use to test
some machine learning algorithm in trying to see how its performance
depends on the size of the training set size. For this, one can draw a
smaller subset of data, learn the classifier, and test it on remaining
data set. To do this in a just way (by Salzberg, 1997), we perform
k-fold cross validation but use only a proportion of the data for
training. The output of the widget should then look something
like:</p>

<img src="learningcurve-output.png">

<p>Now back to channels and tokens. Input and output channels for our
widget are defined by:</p>

<xmp class="code">self.inputs = [("Data", ExampleTable, self.dataset), ("Learner", orange.Learner, self.learner, 0)]
</xmp>

<p>Notice that everything is pretty much the same as it was with
widgets from previous lessons, the only difference being "0" as the
last value in the list that defines the <code>Learner</code>
channel. This "0" says that this is a multi-input channel. If it would
be "1" (default), it would mean that the widget can receive the input
only from one widget.</p>

<p>How does the widget know from which widget did the token come from?
In Orange, tokens are sent around with an id of a widget that is
sending the token (essentially, with a pointer to the corresponding
widget object), and having a multi-input channel only tells Orange to
send a token together with sending widget id, the two arguments with
which the receiving function is called. For our <code>Learner</code>
channel the receiving function is <code>learner</code>, and this looks
like the following:</p>

<xmp class="code">def learner(self, learner, id=None):
    ids = [x[0] for x in self.learners]
    if not learner: # remove a learner and corresponding results
        if not ids.count(id):
            return # no such learner, removed before
        indx = ids.index(id)
        for i in range(self.steps):
            self.curves[i].remove(indx)
        del self.scores[indx]
        del self.learners[indx]
        self.setTable()
    else:
        if ids.count(id): # update 
                   # (already seen a learner from this source)
            indx = ids.index(id)
            self.learners[indx] = (id, learner)
            if self.data:
                curve = self.getLearningCurve([learner])
                score = [self.scoring[self.scoringF][1](x)[0] for x in curve]
                self.scores[indx] = score
                for i in range(self.steps):
                    self.curves[i].add(curve[i], 0, replace=indx)
        else: # add new learner
            self.learners.append((id, learner))
            if self.data:
                curve = self.getLearningCurve([learner])
                score = [self.scoring[self.scoringF][1](x)[0] for x in curve]
                self.scores.append(score)
                if len(self.curves):
                    for i in range(self.steps):
                        self.curves[i].add(curve[i], 0)
                else:
                    self.curves = curve
    if len(self.learners):
        self.infob.setText("%d learners on input." % len(self.learners))
    else:
        self.infob.setText("No learners.")
    self.commitBtn.setEnabled(len(self.learners))
    if self.data:
        self.setTable()
</xmp>

<p>OK, this looks like one long and complicated function. But be
patient! Learning curve is not the simplest widget there is, so
there's some extra code in the function above to manage the
information it handles in the appropriate way. To understand the
signals, though, you should only understand the following. We store
the learners (objects that learn from data) in the list
<code>self.learners</code>. The list contains tuples with an id of the
widget that has sent the learner, and the learner itself. We could
store such information in a dictionary as well, but for this
particular widget the order of learners is important, and we thought
that list is a more appropriate structure.</p>

<p>The function above first checks if the learner sent is empty
(<code>None</code>). Remember that sending an empty learner
essentially means that the link with the sending widget was removed,
hance we need to remove such learner from our list. If a non-empty
learner was sent, then it is either a new learner (say, from a widget
we have just linked to our learning curve widget), or an update
version of the previously sent learner. If the later is the case, then
there is an ID which we already have in the learners list, and we
need to replace previous information on that learner. If a new learner
was sent, the case is somehow simpler, and we just add this learner
and its learning curve to the corresponding variables that hold this
information.</p>

<p>The function that handles <code>learners</code> as shown above is
the most complicated function in our learning curve widget. In fact,
the rest of the widget does some simple GUI management, and calls
learning curve routines from <a
href="/doc/modules/orngTest.htm">orngTest</a> and performance
scoring functions from <a
href="/doc/modules/orngStat.htm">orngStat</a>. I rather like
the easy by which new scoring functions are added to the widget, since
all that is needed is the augmenting the list</p>

<xmp class="code">self.scoring = [("Classification Accuracy", orngStat.CA),\
                ("AUC", orngStat.AUC), \
                ("BrierScore", orngStat.BrierScore),\
                ("Information Score", orngStat.IS),\
                ("Sensitivity", orngStat.sens), \
                ("Specificity", orngStat.spec)]
</xmp>

<p>which is defined in the initialization part of the widget. The
other useful trick in this widget is that evaluation (k-fold cross
validation) is carried out just once given the learner, data set and
evaluation parameters, and scores are then derived from class
probability estimates as obtained from the evaluation procedure. Which
essentially means that switching from one to another scoring function
(and displaying the result in the table) takes only a split of a
second. To see the rest of the widget, check out <a
href="OWLearningCurveA.py">its code</a>.</p>

<h2>Using Several Output Channels</h2>

<p>There's nothing new here, only that we need a widget that has
several output channels of the same type to illustrate the idea of the
default channels in the next section. For this purpose, we will modify
our sampling widget as defined in previous lessons such that it will
send out the sampled data to one channel, and all other data to
another channel. The corresponding channel definition of this widget
is:</p>

<xmp class="code">self.outputs = [("Sampled Data", ExampleTable), ("Other Data", ExampleTable)]
</xmp>

</p>We used this in the third incarnation of <a
href="OWDataSamplerC.py">data sampler widget</a>, with essentially the
only other change in the code in the <code>selection</code> and
<code>commit</code> functions:</p>

<xmp class="code">def selection(self):
    indices = orange.MakeRandomIndices2(p0=self.proportion / 100.)
    ind = indices(self.dataset)
    self.sample = self.dataset.select(ind, 0)
    self.otherdata = self.dataset.select(ind, 1)
    self.infob.setText('%d sampled instances' % len(self.sample))

def commit(self):
    self.send("Sampled Data", self.sample)
    self.send("Other Data", self.otherdata)
</xmp>

<p>If a widget that has multiple channels of the same type is
connected to a widget that accepts such tokens, Orange Canvas opens a
window asking the user to confirm which channels to connect. The
channel mentioned in <code>self.outputs</code> is connected by
default. Hence, if we have just connected Data Sampler
(C) widget to a Data Table widget in a schema below:</p>

<img src="datasampler-totable.png">

<p>we would get a following window quering users for information on
which channels to connect:</p>

<img src="datasampler-channelquerry.png">

<h2>Default Channels (When Using Input Channels of the Same Type)</h2>

<p>Now, let's say we want to extend our learning curve widget such
that it does the learning the same way as it used to, but can -
provided that such data set is defined - test the
learners (always) on the same, external data set. That is, besides the
training data set, we need another channel of the same type but used
for training data set. Notice, however, that most often we will only
provide the training data set, so we would not like to be bothered (in
Orange Canvas) with the dialog which channel to connect to, as the
training data set channel will be the default one.</p>

<p>When enlisting the input channel of the same type, the non-default
channels have a special fourth value in the channel specification
list. So for our new <a href="OWLearningCurveB.py">learning curve</a>
widget, the channel specification is:</p>

<xmp class="code">self.inputs = [("Train Data", ExampleTable, self.trainset), ("Test Data", ExampleTable, self.testset, 1, 1), ("Learner", orange.Learner, self.learner, 0)]
</xmp>

<p>That is, the <code>Test Data</code> channel is a single-token
channel (third parameter) which is not a default one (where "1"
indicates that this is a so-called minor channel). To test how this
works, connect a file widget to a learning curve widget and - nothing
will really happen:</p>

<img src="file-to-learningcurveb.png">

<p>That is, no window with a query on which channels
to connect to will open. To find out which channels got connected,
double click on the green link between the two widgets:</p>
