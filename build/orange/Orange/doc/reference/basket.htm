<INDEX name="basket file format">
<H1>Basket format</H1>

<P>Basket files (.basket) are suitable for representing sparse
data. Each example is represented by a line in the file. The line is
written as a comma-separated list of name-value pairs. Here's an
example of such file.</P>

<XMP class=code>nobody, expects, the, Spanish, Inquisition=5
our, chief, weapon, is, surprise=3, surprise=2, and, fear,fear, and, surprise
our, two, weapons, are, fear, and, surprise, and, ruthless, efficiency
to, the, Pope, and, nice, red, uniforms, oh damn
</XMP>

<P>The file contains four examples. The first examples has five
attributes defined, "nobody", "expects", "the", "Spanish" and
"Inquisition"; the first four have (the default) value of 1.0 and the
last has a value of 5.0.</P>

<P>The attributes that appear in the domain aren't defined in any
headers or even separate files, as with other formats supported by
Orange.</P>

<P>If attribute appears more than once, its values are added. For
instance, the value of attribute "surprise" in the second examples is
6.0 and the value of "fear" is 2.0; the former appears three times
with values of 3.0, 2.0 and 1.0, and the latter appears twice with
value of 1.0.</P>

<P>All attributes are loaded as optional meta-attributes, so zero
values don't take any memory (unless they are <I>given</I>, but
initialized to zero). See also section on meta-attributes in the
reference for <a href="Domain.htm">domain descriptors</a>.</p>

<p>Notice that at the time of writing this reference only association
rules can directly use examples presented in the basket format.</P>
