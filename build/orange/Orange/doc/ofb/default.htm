<H1>Orange for Beginners</H1>

<p>If you are new to Orange, than this is probably the best place
to start. &ldquo;Beginning with Orange&rdquo; was written with a
purpose to provide a gentle tutorial over basic functionality of
Orange. The tutorial includes:</p>

<ul>

<li><A href="start.htm">Start with Orange</A> shows hot to run python
and import Orange,</li>

<li><A href="load_data.htm">Load-in the data</A> speaks about data
formats and how to load the read the data from files,</li>

<li><A href="basic_exploration.htm">Basic data exploration</A>
demonstrates how to perform some basic statistical analysis, </li>

<li>
  <A href="classification.htm">Classification</A> describes how to set-up the learners, build classifiers, and evaluate them using cross-validation or alike, </li>

   <ul>

   <li><A href="c_basics.htm">My first Orange classifier</A> builds
   naive Bayesian classifier and shows how to use to predict class
   labels and probabilities,</li>

   <li><A href="c_otherclass.htm">Selected classification methods</A>
   lists other classification methods provided by Orange,</li>

   <li><A href="c_performance.htm">Testing and evaluating</A> speaks
   about of testing and comparison of learners, </li>

   <li><A href="c_pythonlearner.htm">Build your own learner</A> is a
   chapter on how to prototype your own learners/classifiers in
   Python.</li>
   
</ul>

<li><A href="regression.htm">Regression</A> introduces several methods
that can be used for regression modelling, </li>

<li><A href="assoc.htm">Association rules</A> shows how to use
Orange's association rules,</li>

<li><A href="other.htm">Other topics</A></li>

   <ul>

   <li><A href="o_categorization.htm">Categorization</A> lists several
   methods within Orange that can be used for categorization, </li>

   <li><A href="o_fss.htm">Feature subset selection</A></li>

   <li><A href="o_ensemble.htm">Ensemble techniques</A> discusses how
   to use a particular Orange's module for boosting and bagging, </li>

   </ul>

<li><A href="domain.htm">Basic Data Manipulation</A> illustrates how
to select attributes, instances, craft new domains and data sets, and
alike. Finishes with wrapper-based feature subset selector, </li>

<li><A href="uncovered.htm">What we did not cover</A></li>

</ul>

<p>As Orange is integrated within Python, the tutorial is in essence a
guide through some basic Orange scripting in this language. Although
relying on Python, those of you who have some knowledge on programming
won&rsquo;t need to learn Python first: the tutorial should be simple
enough to skip learning Python itself. If, however, you will later
want to develop your own methods and test some of your more complex
ideas, you may want to jump to <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python&rsquo;s site</a> for some
material on this rather new and appealing scripting language.</p>

<p>Through the tutorial, some basic python scripts are developed that
most often read the data and do something with it. You will find that
every piece of code we present has a pointer to the file with this
code that you can download (use the mouse, press right-button on the
link, and choose &ldquo;Save Target As &hellip;&rdquo;. You will also
find that with it are pointers to the data files that you can download
too. We recommend you to first open a special folder where you want to
save both the scripts and files that come with them.</p>

<p>We expect this tutorial to be interactive, that is, we would like
you to try Orange while reading the tutorial. Hence, we start with the
basics on <a href="start.htm">where to download Python and Orange and
how to start Orange scripting</a>.</p>

<p>For your convenience, you may also download a <a
href="/download.html">stand-alone version of Orange
documentation</a> that also includes all script files and data
files.</p>

<P>Note: The documentation posted on the web is updated from the CVS in
real-time and refers to the latest snapshot of Orange. If you encounter
any inconsistencies please compare the standalone documentation with the
one on the web.</P>
