<H1>Classification</H1>
<index name="classification">

<p>A substantial part of Orange is devoted to machine learning
methods for classification. These methods start from the data that
incorporates classified instances (e.g., a collection of attribute
values that are classified to a certain class), and attempt to
develop models that would, given the set of attribute-values,
predict a class for such instance.</p>

<p>This part of tutorial will show you how to use several of
Orange's classification methods. We start with a simple ones
(<a href="c_basics.htm">naive Bayes</a>) and then demonstrate the
use of <a href="c_otherclass.htm">several other</a> as well.
Another issue we cover is <a href="c_performance.htm">assessing the
predictive quality</a> of resulting classifiers. Orange was meant
as a versatile tool that would also allow researchers to develop
their own methods (or use a combination of existing methods). It is
here where we think that Orange in combination with Python
scripting really shines. Because Python may prove as a powerful
tool to prototype and test your ideas, we include a special lesson
on <a href="c_pythonlearner.htm">building the classifiers in
Python</a>.</p>
