<H1>Start With Orange</H1>

<p>To start Orange Scripting, you will need to <a href="/download.html">download</a>
and install Orange. Notice that
Python installation comes in two flavors: Python itself, or Python
embedded within ActiveState environment. We recommend you to
install the later. The biggest bonus is a free editor, called
PythonWin, with code completion feature. Orange and Orange modules
come with many keywords for classes and methods, and it helps if
editor can help you find the right names for them. Here is a
partial snapshot of PythonWin with this feature:</p>

<p>Once you have installed Python and Orange, open the Command
Prompt (usually at Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Accessories menu), type
python, and once you get Python&rsquo;s prompt
(&ldquo;&gt;&gt;&gt;&rdquo;) type &ldquo;import orange&rdquo; and
press &lt;Return&gt; (or &lt;Enter&gt;; whatever the biggest key on
your keyboard is). If Python does not complain (like in the window
below), you have just successfully completed the installation.
Press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;Z&gt; followed by &lt;Return&gt; to exit
Python.</p>

<p>If you have ActiveState Python (which we recommend), than you
may try to run PythonWin (Start-&gt;ActiveState
ActivePython-&gt;PythonWin Environment). Go to its Interactive
Window (this should open by itself within PythonWin window), and on
prompt &ldquo;&gt;&gt;&gt;&rdquo; type &ldquo;import orange&rdquo;.
If this worked through Command Prompt, it should work here as well.
To try to see how keyword completion works, start typing
orange.sys.version and see how PythonWin can help you with that
(type &lt;tab&gt; if you like what PythonWin proposes). Always type
&lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;Return&gt; at the end of the command line!</p>

<p>The Interactive Window of PythonWin has a nice property that if
you find some line with a command that you have already entered,
move cursor on any part of it and then press return, it will open a
new command line with exactly the same command and allow to edit
it.</p>

<p>Now enough with the basics on Python environment. Let&rsquo;s
start using Orange and first see how to <a href=
