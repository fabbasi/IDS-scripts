<h1>orngAssoc: Orange Association Rules Module</h1>
<index name="modules+association rules">
<br>

<P>Module orngAssoc provides a few utility functions for association rules. First, there is some compatibility stuff related with the previous version of the module. We won't document this. The two useful functions are one for printing the rules and another for sorting them.</P>

<dl class="attributes">
<dt>printRules(rules, ms = [])</dt>
<dd>Prints out the rules. If <code>ms</code> is left empty, only the rules are printed. If <code>ms</code> contains rules' attributes, e.g. <code>["support", "confidence"]</code>, these are printed out as well. See the available attributes in the <a href="../reference/associationRules.htm">Reference Guide's page on association rules</a>, and a few examples in <a href="../ofb/assoc.htm">Orange for Beginners</a>.</dd>

<dt>sort(rules, ms = ["support"])</dt>
<dd>Sorts the rules according to the given criteria. The default key is "support"; you can list multiple keys, as shown in examples in <a href="../ofb/assoc.htm">Orange for Beginners</a>.</dd>
