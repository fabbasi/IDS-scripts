<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Select Attributes widget is used to manually compose your data
domain, that is, to decide which attributes will be used and
how. Orange distinguishes between ordinary attributes, an (optional)
class attributes and meta attributes. For instance, for building a
classification model, the domain would be composed of a set of
attributes and a discrete class attribute. Meta attributes are not
used in modelling, but several widgets can use them for providing
optional labels to instances.</p>

<p>Orange attributes are typed and are either discrete, continuous or
a character string. The attribute type is marked with a symbol
appearing before the name of the attribute (D, C, S,
respectively).</p>

<p>Changes made to the domain are propagated to the output by pressing an <span class="option">Apply</span> button. <span class="option">Reset</span> will present
the attributes as defined in original domain in the data set from the
input signal</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Below is a simple example how to use this widget. The input is fed
directly from the <a href="File.htm">File</a> widget, and the output
to the <a href="DataTable.htm">Data Table</a> widget. We have also
linked the former to the File widget so that one can inspect the
difference in the domain composition.</p>
