<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This is a versatile widget with 2-D visualization of classification
tree that allows user to alter the appearance of the tree and
associate tree-based data to graphical elements of the
visualization. In addition, user can select a node, instructing the
widget to commit the data associated to the node to its output channel,
thus in combination with other widget obtaining interesting schemas
for explorative data analysis.</p>

Widget" border=0></a></center>

<h3>General Tab</h3>

<p>Several general parameters that affect the drawing size of the
displayed tree may be set in the General tab. Here, user can set the
zoom factor and define the vertical and horizontal spacing between the
nodes. Node bubble information (like the one displayed in the snapshot
above) may be turned off, and user may instruct the widget to truncate
the text labels to fit provided space.</p>

<h3>Tree Tab</h3>

<a href="ClassificationTreeGraph-TreeTab.png"><img class="screenshot"
src="ClassificationTreeGraph-TreeTab-S.png" alt="Classification Tree Graph
- Tree Tab" border=0 align="left"></a>

<p>In this tab the user can define the depth to which the widget will
display the tree (may be useful when very large trees are
induced). The edges between the nodes in the tree graph are drawn
according to the maximum width defined in this tab. All the edges will
be of equal width if <span class="option">No dependency</span> is chosen in the
<span class="option">Reference for Edge Width</span> box. When <span class="option">Root node</span> is selected
instead, the width of the edge will correspond to the proportion of
instances in the corresponding node with respect to all the instances
in the training data set (that is, instances in the root node). That
is, under this selection, the edge will get thinner and thinner when
traversing toward the bottom of the tree. Selection of <span class="option">Parent
node</span> makes the edge width correspond to proportion of instances in
the nodes with respect to the instances in their parent node.</p>

<h3>Node Tab</h3>

<a href="ClassificationTreeGraph-NodeTab.png"><img class="screenshot"
src="ClassificationTreeGraph-NodeTab-S.png" alt="Classification Tree Graph
- Node Tab" border=0></a></center>

<p>Parameters from the Node Tab govern the appearance of tree nodes
and define what is displayed in the node box, of which the size can be
set manually (<span class="option">Node Width</span>). Tree nodes can display two lines of
information selected by the user (<span class="option">Show Info</span> box). In the
snapshot the probability for the target class (republican) was
reported in the first line in the node, and number of instances from
the training set that reached this node in the second text
line. Because of treatment of missing values, these numbers may not
necessary be integers.</p>

<p>The color of the node:
<ul>
<li>may be uniform (<span class="option">Node Color</span> set to
<span class="option">Default</span>),</li>
<li>correspond to number of instances in the node
with respect to the number of instances in the root node (<span class="option">Instances
in node</span>),</li>
<li>may report on the probability of the majority class
(<span class="option">Majority class probability</span>) where one would expect that the
color intensity would be higher towards the leaves of the node,</li>
<li>may report on probability of the target class (<span class="option">Target class
probability</span>), with more intense colors marking the nodes where
instances of target class are more frequent, and</li>
<li>may report on the distribution of instances with target class,
where the intensity of node color corresponds to proportion of the
target class instances in the node with respect to the target class
instances in the root node (<span class="option">Target class
distribution</span>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Navigation</h3>

<p><span class="option">Find Root</span> aligns the position of the window such that the
root node is displayed in the center. If user selects the node
(left-click on the node), <span class="option">Find Selected</span> would bring the widow
in position to display the selected node in the center. More advanced
navigation is supported by a navigator window (click on the
<span class="option">Navigator</span> button), which displays a complete tree with a box
signifying the currently viewed part of the tree in the main
window. This box can be moved around thus exposing different parts of
the tree in the main window. The tree visualization in the navigator
corresponds to the visualization parameters set in the main
window. Navigator also supports bubble info box which is displayed
when mousing over the node in the tree.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Following is a simple schema where we have read the data,
constructed the classification tree and viewed it in our tree
viewer. Notice that if both the viewer and the widget that constructs
the classification tree are open, any run of tree induction algorithm
will have an immediate effect in the visualization. You can thus use
this combination to explore how are the changes in induction algorithm
reflected in the structure of the resulting tree.</p>

- Simple Schema" border=0></a></center>

<p>Any click on the node of the tree would place the related data
instances on the widget's output channel. This is explored in the
schema below that shows this data in the data table and as a data
subset in the scatterplot visualizer (for scatterplot to display the
selected data properly, make sure that the tree data is passed as a
data subset; this can simply be done by connecting scatterplot to the
Data widget first, and connecting it to the tree visualization widget
next).</p>
