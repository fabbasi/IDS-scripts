<h1>Catalog of Orange Widgets</h1>

<p>Orange Widgets are building blocks of Orange's graphical user's
interface and its visual programming interface. The purpose of this
documention is to describe the basic functionality of the widgets,
and show how are they used in interaction with other widgets.</p>

<p>Widgets in Orange can be used on their own, or within a separate
application. This documention will however describe them as used
within Orange Canvas, and application which trough visual programming
allows gluing of widgets together in whatcan be anything from simple
data analysis schema to a complex explorative data analysis
application.</p>

<p>In Orange Canvas, widgets are grouped according to their
functionality. We stick to the same grouping in this documentation,
and cluster widgets accoring to their arrangement withing Canvas's
toolbar.</p>

<P><small>Orange is a work in progress and so is its documentation. Since
documentation and widgets can be downloaded separately and from different
sources, this help file may omit some widgets functionality or describe
something your version of widgets does not have yet.</small></P>
